Its a simple project to provide a responsive frontend to show a multi-column list of products for an e-commerce website as you can see on https://www.flaconi.de/parfum/.

The product entities have the following structure and will be provided in an array of products:


```js
{
  id: <String>,
  name: <String>,
  slug: <String>,
  brand: <String>,
  type: <String>,
  image: <String>,
  price: <Integer>,
  size: <String>,
  rating: <Integer>
}
```
 - `id` is the product SKU
 - `image` contains a full URL
 - `price` is in cents
 - `rating` with a scale of 0 to 100 (Displayed with 5 stars rating)
